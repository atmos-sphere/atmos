# Risk 1: Copyright Strikes
One of the primary features of Atmos is that it is supposed to be a location to chill and play music. An obvious risk that will arise with this is that if users can choose what songs they would like in their sphere, they might choose copyrighted music and backgrounds. This isn't necessarily bad since spheres aren't monetized, but corporations will still want money for letting people listen to their music or use their content as backgrounds. There will need to be ads added somewhere for when copyrighted songs/backgrounds play to appease to the big corporations. This might be harder to handle for when video chat is implemented since that will add more legality issues when people start streaming movies.

# Risk 2: Explicit Content
Since this is the internet, people will use whatever site or application they can find to be degenerates. As a result, there will be spheres created for content not suitable of children (or for anyone in some cases). Atmos will need clear rules in the terms and conditions stating that either the site cannot be used for this 18+ content or if explicit content is allowed, then there will need to be rules on what is acceptable and the restrictions required to ensure users under the age of 18 do not see this explicit content. Regardless of which of the 2 rules are chosen, extreme explicit content like real life blood, gore, and death, as well as illegal pornography like child porn will be banned and handled with harsher consequences.

# Risk 3: Distribution of Illegal Content
Connecting with the past 2 risks listen above, other illegal content can cause risks to Atmos. This includes: 
- Distribution of pirated games, movies, and other medias or the use of pirated media on any sphere.
- Distribution of content that is illegal according to Canadian and International Laws or the use of this content on any sphere.
- Distribution of illegal hacking software such as trojans, malware, or other viruses that are cybercrimes.

# Risk 4: Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) Attacks
There might be a possibility that someone might want to take down the Atmos servers by causing DDoS attacks. This can be devastating and will need to be handled as soon as possible when it happens since it will cause enough network trafficking that it'd be impossible for users to use Atmos.

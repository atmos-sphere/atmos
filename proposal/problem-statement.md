Based on an [article][1] regarding suicide risk and prevention during the
pandemic , suicide rates during the covid 19 pandemic are expected to rise due
to a decline in mental health cause by fear, self-isolation, and physical
distancing , leading to mental illnesses such as depression, anxiety, and
post-traumatic stress disorder(PTSD).

An application for social interactions in a virtual platform may prove
imperative in improving mental health for its users in not just during the
COVID 19 pandemic, but during regular times as well by providing users with
an option to connect and interact with other humans, preventing more people
from being deprived of their social needs by a virtual form of human
interaction.

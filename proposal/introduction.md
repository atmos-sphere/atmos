The unexpected sweep of the COVID-19 pandemic has driven an invisible barrier
between friends, families and loved ones as widely dreaded curfews, quarantines
and other social distancing procedures are slowly integrated into our daily

beings, humanity’s need for basic human interaction grows exponentially as
people spend increasing amounts of time in isolation and loneliness. A need
which if suppressed, may lead to a steady decline in mental health.

PROJECT: Atmos

Atmos is a social app where people can host chat rooms with chill or themed music and live background wallpapers. Music/chat channels are called "Spheres" (Atmos-spheres) and they all follow different themes. For example, you could have a Sphere for low-fi chill beats with an aquarium live stream taking up the whole screen. Invite your friends and chill out in the chat room while the fish swim around on screen - even after COVID curfew!

Spheres can be long-lived, sticking around like radio stations and being maintained by a dedicated user who prunes and customizes the music and background images, or you could create a temporary sphere for a short time frame and invite your friends for a laid-back meeting.

Features:
- Easily select a music playlist based on a theme or music genre
- Select playlists from spotify or other providers
- Select from suggested background streams/videos (fishy aquarium, fireplace, snowy mountains, mystical forest, coffee shop, etc.)
- Manually select a background stream: Atmos will play Youtube video playlists or single videos on repeat, or connect to other live streams, or play gifs, etc.
- Auto-sphere: select a theme and get a randomized unique sphere with music playlist and background stream to suite that theme.
- Later on: voice chat support, video chat support, forgo the background image and watch a movie with friends (great during covid).
- Later on: connect your sphere to another sphere, creating an icon or button in your chat room that people can click to jump into another Sphere.
- Very basic and easy to use video customization such as converting the stream to black and white, adding borders, or filters on the stream.

COMPETITORS:

The app would be somewhat similar to watching a livestream like this:

But Atmos would be a dedicated social app around the above concept.

Atmos has many similarities to other apps with chat features, but there are enough gimmicks that differentiate it.

# PROJECT: Atmos

Atmos is a social app where people can host chat rooms with chill or themed
music and live background wallpapers. Music/chat channels are called "Spheres"
(Atmos-spheres) and they all follow different themes. For example, you could
have a Sphere for low-fi chill beats with an aquarium live stream taking up the
whole screen. Invite your friends and chill out in the chat room while the fish
swim around on screen - even after COVID curfew!

Spheres can be long-lived, sticking around like radio stations and being
maintained by a dedicated user who prunes and customizes the music and
background images, or you could create a temporary sphere for a short time frame
and invite your friends for a laid-back meeting.

Features:

- Easily select a music playlist based on a theme or music genre
- Select playlists from spotify or other providers
- Select from suggested background streams/videos (fishy aquarium, fireplace,
  snowy mountains, mystical forest, coffee shop, etc.)
- Manually select a background stream: Atmos will play Youtube video playlists
  or single videos on repeat, or connect to other live streams, or play gifs,
  etc.
- Auto-sphere: select a theme and get a randomized unique sphere with music
  playlist and background stream to suite that theme.
- Later on: voice chat support, video chat support, forgo the background image and watch a movie with friends (great during covid).
- Later on: connect your sphere to another sphere, creating an icon or button in
  your chat room that people can click to jump into another Sphere.
- Very basic and easy to use video customization such as converting the stream
  to black and white, adding borders, or filters on the stream.

The app would be somewhat similar to watching a livestream like this:

But Atmos would be a dedicated social app around the above concept.

Atmos has many similarities to other apps with chat features, but there are
enough gimmicks that differentiate it.

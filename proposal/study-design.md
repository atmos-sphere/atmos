# Study Design

As per the hypothesis, the idea is that the music, calm background and a platform for socializing will positively affect a user's mental health. To test whether such activities in fact have a discernible impact on mental health, we shall conduct a study involving 70 participants.

The 70 participants will be split in 7 groups of 10 participants each. The groups will have each be subjected to a different form of activity, and its impact will be evaluated based on the users' evolution of mood through and at the end of the activity. 

At the beginning of the study, all participants will be given a questionnaire in order to determine their mental state, and each given a *happiness level* based on their results.

The 7 groups will have the following activities they will be a part of:
- **Group A:** View only the animated background.
- **Group B:** Listen only the *chill beats* or curated playlist.
- **Group C:** Participate only in the chat along with other users in the group.
- **Group D:** Listen to music, as well as view the animated background.
- **Group E:** View only the animated background, as well as participate in the chat.
- **Group F:** Listen to the music, and participate in the chat.
- **Group G:** Listen to the music, participate in the chat as well as view the animated background.

|         | Animated Background | Chill Beats | Live Chat |
|---------|---------------------|-------------|-----------|
| Group 1 | X                   |             |           |
| Group 2 |                     | X           |           |
| Group 3 |                     |             | X         |
| Group 4 | X                   | X           |           |
| Group 5 |                     | X           | X         |
| Group 6 | X                   |             | X         |
| Group 7 | X                   | X           | X         |

After the designated acitivity of 30 minute, the moods or *happiness levels* of the 70 participants will be evaluated. If our hypothesis is correct, there should be a statistically significant enhancement of the participants' moods after the activity, with the highest effect in group G.

area.

Feelings of loneliness born from social isolation/withdrawal during the covid
19 pandemic are the main problems that project Atmos aims to confront. Such
feelings can easily lead to mood disorders/ illnesses such as depression,
anxiety which can be deteriorating to mental health, which in severe cases leads
to physically harmful behavior. Project Atmos aims to provide these people with

scenario where one is physically isolated and lacks social interaction. By
doing so, gradually improve mental health amongst users and bring about more
positive emotions stemming from being able to communicate with friends and
family.

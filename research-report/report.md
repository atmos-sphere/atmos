## Introduction

Project Atmos is designed to function as a social media application by allowing
users to host custom chat rooms with themed music and live background
wallpapers.

Prime features of Project Atmos include

- Creation and hosting of "Spheres", which are musical chatting channels with
  voice, video and text chat functionality.
- Customizable animated backgrounds for chatting channels

Project Atmos, Or Atmosphere in its deployed state aims to provided users with
means of social interaction with friends and family, and by doing so reduce
feelings of loneliness. Furthermore, similar to other social media platforms,
this project aims to act as a mainstream media outlet for organizations and
businesses to reach and communicate with their audience in a public chatting
area.

Feelings of loneliness born from social isolation/withdrawal during the covid 19
pandemic are the main problems that project Atmos aims to confront. Such
feelings can easily lead to mood disorders/ illnesses such as depression,
anxiety which can be deteriorating to mental health, which in severe cases leads
to physically harmful behavior. Project Atmos aims to provide these people with
a means to communicate and socialize in not just a pandemic scenario, but any
scenario where one is physically isolated and lacks social interaction. By doing
so, gradually improve mental health amongst users and bring about more positive
emotions stemming from being able to communicate with friends and family.

## Biggest Risks

### Risk 1: Copyright Strikes

One of the primary features of ATMOS is that to act as a social hub with 
user-selected background music. An obvious risk that will arise with this is that
if users can choose what songs they would like in their sphere, they might choose
copyrighted music and backgrounds if they are to choose external music which are
not featured on the spotify platform. This isn't necessarily bad since spheres
aren't monetized, but corporations will still want money for letting people
listen to their music or use their content as backgrounds, which may lead to 
arising legal issues which may demand significant resources to resolve. Thus it may
be neccesary for the addition of advertisements during applicaiton usage to appease
the big corporations. This might be harder to handle for when video chat is
implemented since that will add more legality issues when people start streaming
movies.

### Risk 2: Explicit Content

There is a risk of malicous users using the application to post inappriate content
,which can ruin the experience for other users especially if underage users are 
exposed to such content. An example of thismaybe be if spheres with content not 
suitable of children are created. ATMOSwill need clear rules in the terms and 
conditions stating that either the sitecannot be used for this 18+ content or if 
explicit content is allowed, certain rules and regulations will need to be set 
on what is acceptable content and the some restrictions will be  required to ensure
users under the age of 18 are not exposed to any explicit content. Violators which
post explicit content featuring physical blood, gore, and death, as well as illegal 
pornography such as sexual content featuring children/minors will be banned and 
handled with harsher consequences.

### Risk 3: Distribution of Illegal Content

Distribution of illegal content such as the may bring about a plethora of legal 
issues:

- Distribution of pirated games, movies, and other medias or the use of pirated
  media on any sphere.
- Distribution of content that is illegal according to Canadian and
  International Laws or the use of this content on any sphere.
- Distribution of illegal hacking software such as trojans, malware, or other
  viruses that are cybercrimes.

### Risk 4: Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) Attacks

 Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) Attacks pose a serious threat to ATMOS
 servers and may be conducted by malicous users who have the intent of 
 disrupting application services. Thus appropriate security protocols and 
 malware defense software should be deployed in order to prevent such attacks
 from succeeding.

It is hypothesized that using Atmosphere would cause improvements in the feelings
of loneliness. It is believed that the music and background animations would have
a calming effect on the users, and the online chat would provide an avenue for users
to socially interact in a relaxed environment reducing their feelings of social
isolation.

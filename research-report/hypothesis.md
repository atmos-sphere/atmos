## Hypothesis

The goal of Project Atmos is to help individuals counter feelings of loneliness
and possibly even improve or prevent depression. It can be difficult to directly
track such feelings, specially in the short period of this study, therefore we
measure possible improvements in feelings of loneliness and depression by measuring
any postive changes in mood after using AtmoSphere. The idea is that the chill music
and background animations will have a calming effect on the users, and improve
their general mood based on calming visuals and sound frequencies. Similarly, the
live chat will provide social support for individuals lacking close contacts in real
life.

We hypothesize using Atmosphere would make result in an improvement of mood, and
such an effect would be cumulative. The improvement in mood can be measured via
questionnaires, and the results extrapolated to mean improvement in loneliness
and depression systems.

## Hypothesis

The goal of Project Atmos is to help individuals counter feelings of loneliness
and possibly even improve or prevent depression. It can be difficult to directly
track such feelings, especially in the short period of this study, therefore we
measure possible improvements in feelings of loneliness and depression by
measuring any positive changes in mood after using Atmos-Sphere. The idea is
that the chill music and background animations will have a calming effect on the
users, and improve their general mood based on calming visuals and sound
frequencies. Similarly, the live chat will provide social support for
individuals lacking close contacts in real life.

We hypothesize using Atmosphere would result in an improvement of mood, and such
an effect would be cumulative. The improvement in mood can be measured via
questionnaires, and the results extrapolated to mean improvement in loneliness
and depression systems.

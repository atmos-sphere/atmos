## Evaluation

### OLD

In order to measure symptoms of anxiety and depression, our participants will
fill out questionnaires related to depression and anxiety symptoms, as well as
participate in an unstructured interview to informally evaluate their symptoms.
The questionnaires, “Beck’s Depression Inventory” which measures depression,
and the “GAD-7” which measures anxiety, generate a score based on the severity
of the symptoms, ranging from 0-3. We chose these two tests as they provide
qualitative and quantitative metrics. Together, they will allow us to perform
data triangulation, ensure the accuracy of our results, as well as provide a
holistic view of our application’s effects on the user. As such, we will know
our hypothesis holds true if we notice a significant decrease in both anxiety
and depression symptoms. We believe this ensemble of techniques will help us
to properly evaluate our hypothesis. In the future, we would like to conduct
research within a longer time frame, as this would help us get a better
overview of the application’s effect on mental distress.

### NEW

The Atmos-Sphere study is designed to investigate the mood of participants as
they use the Atmos social media app. In particular, Atmos-Sphere is interested
in the relationship between social isolation and feelings of loneliness. The
goal of the Atmos sphere app is to reduce the social isolation of study
participants by providing an engaging online social experience. It is believed
that if study participants feel less socially isolated, through the use of the
Atmos app, then their feelings of loneliness will be reduced.

#### Data Collection

Along these lines, the plan is to execute a comprehensive and robust data
collection scheme that tackles the question from two angles: qualitatively, and
quantitatively. Thusly, data will be collected in 3 formats: by questionnaire,
by interview, and finally by web analytics.

##### Questionnaire

A custom, self-administered questionnaire will be created containing both
open-ended and close-ended questions. Close-ended questions will be be ideal for
generating quantitative data points that can be analyzed using statistical and
data analysis techniques, whereas open-ended questions will provide a
qualitative view. The questionnaire will be based on tried-and-true clinical
screening tools such as the PHQ-9, MFQ, and GAD-7 questionniares. <sup>[[1]]
[[2]] [[3]]</sup> These are clinical tools that are commonly used to screen for
mental health issues such as depression and anxiety. The Atmos questionnaire
will take a lighter approach - it will not be designed to screen for mental
health issues, but rather to test for mood, social isolation, and feelings of
loneliness. Nonetheless, The questions will be in a similar format and wording
as the questions in the clinical questionnaires.

##### Interviews

Upon completion of the study, an exit interview will be conducted with each
study partipant. The exit interview will contain mainly open-ended questions
focusing on participants experience in using the Atmos app. These interviews
will contribute to the qualitative data collected from the open-ended Atmos
questionnaire questions. The interview, in combination with the
self-administered questionnaire, will provide one-on-one, qualitative and
quantitative data from the perspective of the study participant.

##### Web Analytics

Finally, web page statistics will be collected throughout the duration of the
study. Metrics such as clicks, time spent viewing components, and more will be
collected from the app. This data will be quantitative, and will provide a
valuable perspective on the level of engagment that Atmos was able to acheive
with its users. The data will be used to construct metrics for the learnability,
ease-of-use, and level of engagement that users have with a social media app in
the Atmos format.

##### Study Format

The format of the study will have participants engage with the Atmos app thrice
over the course of a week, in short sessions of 5-10 minutes, followed by
administering the Atmos questionnaire at the end of each session. The triplet
combination of questionnaires, interviews, and web analytics will provide
multiple perspectives on the data. The goal is to acheive data and
methodological triangulation, which will create a more robust model of the
effect that Atmos has on feelings of social isolation and loneliness. Each of
the 3 investigatory techniques chosen for the study will provide a unique
perspective, the combination of which will be provide the best understanding of
Atmos' users. This study will provide the ground-work for future endeavors of
Atmos-Sphere and improvements to the Atmos social media platform.

#### Data Analysis

**_FROM JUSTIN:_**

Analysis of the data obtained in both the open ended and closed ended questionaires will be primarily evaluated on:

* How much the application has affected the users?
* If the application has affected the user in a positive or negative way?
* If the application has affected the user positively, will the user continue to use the application or will they seek an alternative?
* If the application has affected the user negatively:
 * What user needs did the application not meet?
 * what alternative will the user seek to meet their needs?

As such, based upon the content of the responses received, we can determine the overall effect the application has on the users in both qualitive and quantitive terms. And through that analysis, the hypothesis will be proved/disproved.

In data collection, there are 5 KEY ISSUES:

1. Setting goals
2. Identifying the study population
3. Relationship with participants
4. Triangulation
   - Look at the data from more than one perspective
5. Pilot studies

Also, you might be interested in DATA RECORDING METHODS:
